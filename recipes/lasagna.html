    <h2>Descripton</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become beloved worldwide for its rich, hearty flavors and comforting layers. 
        Traditionally, it is made by layering sheets of pasta with a combination of meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. 
        The most common variations include a meat-based filling with ground beef or pork, along with ricotta or mozzarella cheese, and a savory marinara sauce. 
        The layers are baked together until bubbly and golden, resulting in a dish that is both filling and satisfying. 
        Its versatility also allows for many adaptations, from vegetarian versions with layers of saut√©ed vegetables and ricotta to seafood variations with shrimp or scallops.

        The origins of lasagna date back to ancient times, with early versions of pasta dishes appearing in Greek and Roman cooking. 
        However, it was in Italy that the dish truly evolved, particularly in the region of Emilia-Romagna. Today, lasagna is a popular dish for family gatherings, celebrations, and casual dinners alike. 
        Its ability to be prepared in advance and reheated makes it a convenient choice for busy households. 
        Whether enjoyed in its traditional form or with modern twists, lasagna remains a symbol of comfort food that transcends cultural boundaries.
