This git repo was made with information from the Odin Project: https://theodinproject.com

This project demonstrates my abilities to use headers appropriately, as well as utilize unordered lists <ul> and ordered lists <ol> as well as anchors <a> to link multiple webpages together in HTML. 

This project also puts skills with git commands to the test, frequent commits, and the commit messages.
